  <h2>Hi Everyone!</h2>

  <p>In the spirit of democracy and equal opportunity, we are changing up the nomination process for our book club. Gone are the complicated voting process and predetermined reading lists&mdash;we will now be operating on a <strong>rolling system</strong> where everyone gets a chance to share what they want to read with the group.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>Instead of collecting nominations and narrowing the list to 5 books at the beginning of each iteration, you will now be able to contribute to the club's reading list without having to compete with your peers' nominations. The new procedure is as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Submit your nominations via the form.</li>
    <li>We (Jenny and Kathy) will reach out to discuss your nominations with you. Together, we will select one of your nominations to add to our to-read list. This step will ensure that the books we read are accessible (e.g. not a French rocket science textbook) and available (e.g. soft copy exists).</li>
    <li>Your nomination will be added to our to-read list.</li>
    <li>Since you are required to be the discussion leader of your book, we will figure out the a reading time frame and discussion date that aligns best with your schedule.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The order we go through the to-read list will be determined by these factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your nomination submission time (i.e. rolling system)</li>
    <li>Your availability as discussion leader</li>
    <li>When your last chosen book was read, so others can get a chance before your next book</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You may participate in this process as often as you wish; just be mindful that others may want a chance for the group to read their books as well. :)</p>

  <h3>Nomination Guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure your nominations are around <strong>300-400 pages or shorter</strong>. If you would like to nominate a longer book, you will need to work out a schedule with us to split the book into multiple months.</li>
    <li>Nominations must be in English, or have English translations available.</li>
    <li>Nominations must have easily accessible ebook versions (contact <a href="mailto:mlle.secretaire@gmail.com">Jenny</a> if you have questions).</li>
    <li>You may nominate up to 3 books, one of which will be chosen through a discussion with you.</li>
    <li>You must be the discussion leader for the book that gets chosen.</li>
  </ul>

    </a>
  </div></div>

  <h3>Anything Else?</h3>
  <p>Here are a few more details:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will still designate some time off (month-long hiatus) once in a while, probably after every five books.</li>
    <li>If the to-read list is getting too long, the nomination form will be paused&mdash;it's hard to schedule more than half a year in advance anyway, plus you might change your mind about your nomination months down the line. We will absolutely inform you when we close and re-open the form.</li>
    <li>If you change your mind on your nominated book, send us an email and we'll work it out with you.</li>
    <li>Not sure how to lead a discussion? No worries, we will give you tips and examples from past discussions. All of our discussion leaders have had their own style&mdash;sometimes the best method is your own method. :)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We are hopeful that this new system will better serve the needs and nature of our book club. If you have any suggestions on improvements, please don't hesitate to reach out! As always, happy to have you all here!</p>

  <p>Your book club co-leads,</p>
  <p><strong>Jenny &amp; Kathy</strong></p>
