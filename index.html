      <h3>The Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Submit your nominations via the Google form.</li>
        <li>We (Jenny and Kathy) will reach out to discuss your nominations with you. Together, we will select one of your nominations to add to our to-read list. This step will ensure that the books we read are accessible (e.g. not a French rocket science textbook) and available (e.g. soft copy exists).</li>
        <li>Your nomination will be added to our to-read list.</li>
        <li>Since you are <strong>required to be the discussion leader of your book</strong>, we will figure out the a reading time frame and discussion date that aligns best with your schedule.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The order we go through the to-read list will be determined by these factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your nomination submission time (i.e. rolling system)</li>
        <li>Your availability as discussion leader</li>
        <li>When your last chosen book was read, so others can get a chance before your next book</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You may participate in this process as often as you wish; just be mindful that others may want a chance for the group to read their books as well. :)</p>

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure your nominations are around <strong>300-400 pages or shorter</strong>.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you would like to nominate a longer book, we will need to work out the best schedule for it, whether that is to a) extend the reading period or b) split it into two months.</li>
          <li>The nomination <strong>must not exceed 800 pages</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Nominations must be in English, or have English translations available.</li>
        <li>Nominations must have easily accessible ebook versions (contact <a href="mailto:mlle.secretaire@gmail.com">Jenny</a> if you have questions).</li>
        <li>You may nominate up to 3 books, one of which will be chosen through a discussion with you. We also ask that you <strong>nominate 2 books at a minimum</strong> to give the group more options. If you need ideas for your second nomination, check out our inspiration shelf!</li>
        <li>You must be the discussion leader for the book that gets chosen.</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>Addendums</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We will still designate some time off (month-long hiatus) once in a while, probably after every five books.</li>
    <li>If the to-read list is getting too long, the nomination form will be paused&mdash;it's hard to schedule more than half a year in advance anyway, plus you might change your mind about your nomination months down the line. We will absolutely inform you when we close and re-open the form.</li>
    <li>If you change your mind on your nominated book, send us an email and we'll work it out with you.</li>
    <li>Not sure how to lead a discussion? No worries, we will give you tips and examples from past discussions. All of our discussion leaders have had their own style&mdash;sometimes the best method is your own method. :)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have any suggestions on improvements, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
